Attention! This program is currently under construction.

Fully autonomous Bitcoin Wallet Generator and Checker.
This program continuously generates random Bitcoin private keys, converts the private keys into their respective wallet addresses 
and seeks this addresses in the Blockchain Database.
You need to download the actual Blockchain Database Dump from e.g. https://gz.blockchair.com/bitcoin/addresses/ (>2.5 Gb).
Start the program on a spare computer (let it run 24/7/365) and wait for the results.
